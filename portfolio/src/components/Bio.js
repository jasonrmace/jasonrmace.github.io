                    <p>I am a passionate freelance web developer seeking to use proven front-end development and mobile-first skills to deliver coding excellence. I have built technical experience through founding and creating Discover Our Parks, LLC and while in college working on websites for Rap Pages Magazine and several independent films. I have continued to develop my creative skills working in theatre, building on my previous experience in the entertainment industry. I have fantastic management experience working in a team oriented environment as a logistics/operations manager with Target. Currently, I have continued my technical knowledge by quickly learning new coding languages to deliver on my own project goals. With Discover Our Parks, I also utilize multiple APIâ€™s with ever-changing guidelines and understand the need to monitor and maintain the connections, as well as adapt when needed. I also moved the entire back-end of the website to AWS on a Linux instance and I am utilizing SQL as the database platform.</p>
